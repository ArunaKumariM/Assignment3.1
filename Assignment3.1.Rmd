#Problem Statement
#1. Define an m x n matrix of zeros and then enters a nested-for loop to fill the
#locations of the matrix, only if the two indexes differ
#The purpose is to creite a lower triangular matrix, that is a matrix whose
#elements below the main diagonal are non-zero, the others are left
#untouched to their initialized zero value.
#When the indexes are equal (if condition in the inner loop, which runs over
 #                           j, the column index), a break is executed and the innermost loop is
#interrupted with a direct jump to the instruction following the inner loop,
#which is a print; then control gets to the outer for condition (over the
 #                                                               rows, index i), which is evaluated again.
#If the indexes differ, the assignment is performed and the counter is
#incremented by 1.
#At the end, the program prints the counter ctr, which contains the
#number of elements that were assigned.

x <- as.data.frame(matrix(1:4,4,4)) 
x[upper.tri(x,diag=TRUE)] <- 0

ctr=0
# increment by w when the indexes are different
for (r in 1:nrow(x))   
  for (c in 1:ncol(x))
  {
    if(r==c)
    {
      print(paste("We are at Row", r, "and column",c, " it has values of", x[r,c]," hence skip increment")) 
    }
    else
    {
      x[r,c]=x[r,c]+1

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
